# AutodockVina_3CL-pro
Autodock Vina workflow for docking TSAs into 3CL-pro. 

## Structures

The Rao [`6LU7`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6lu7) 2.16 Ã… structure (with an in-place N3 inhibitor) is one possible starting configuration. 

[`6Y7M`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6y7m) 'complex of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease with a covalent inhibitor. At 1.9A resolution you don't expect there to be much wrong with this, and there isn't. A small handful of dodgy sidechains', as refined further by Tristan Croll:

Diamond managed to solve an empty structure with a solvent-accessible pocket [`6YB7`)](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6yb7), which might be the best (March 22nd 2020) starting point today.

"In my opinion it's fine (great, really). Hard to wrong at 1.29
A! Only real site for concern is the very last residue at the C-terminus
(probably not important in the grand scheme of things). ... OK - one piece of
advice for that. There are lots of residues with altlocs - not sure if any of
them impact on the active site, but make sure you choose carefully (i.e. ensure
the set you choose is self-consistent)."

## Prior docking

Chen et al. (https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.22457.1) (21st Feb 2020) used the [MTiOpenScreen](https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/MTiOpenScreen/) to dock drug repurposing candidates. Their reference structure was a SARS-CoV-1 structure (PDBID: 2DUC), then mutated and minimised with GROMACS and the GROMOS force-field. SI contains this structure prepared for docking.
