# AutodockVina_3CL-pro
Autodock Vina workflow for docking TSAs into 3CL-pro. 

## Structures

The Rao [`6LU7`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6lu7) 2.16 Å structure (with an in-place N3 inhibitor) is one possible starting configuration. 

[`6Y7M`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6y7m) 'complex of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease with a covalent inhibitor. At 1.9A resolution you don't expect there to be much wrong with this, and there isn't. A small handful of dodgy sidechains', as refined further by Tristan Croll:

Diamond managed to solve an empty structure with a solvent-accessible pocket [`6YB7`)](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6yb7), which might be the best (March 22nd 2020) starting point today.

## Prior docking

Chen et al. (https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.22457.1) (21st Feb 2020) used the [MTiOpenScreen](https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/MTiOpenScreen/) to dock drug repurposing candidates. Their reference structure was a SARS-CoV-1 structure (PDBID: 2DUC), then mutated and minimised with GROMACS and the GROMOS force-field. SI contains this structure prepared for docking.
